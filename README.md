### Assumptions

- Your AWS Profile have proper permission configured.
- All the tools required were setup properly
- All the resources are under `us-east-1`
- The cluster name would be `eks-demo`

## Guideline of the tutorial

- Goal 1: Create EKS Cluster with `eksctl`
- Goal 2: Deploy nginx with Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- Goal 3: Find out why Application Load Balancer (ALB) not working?
- Goal 4: Find out why Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) not working?
- Goal 5: HPA is working. Now I want to set Nginx replicas with `kubectl scale ...` but failed. Why?
- Goal 6: Remove HPA and try to scale to `20` manually
- Goal 7: Try to turn ALB entry from HTTP to HTTPS
- Goal 8: How to switch to Network Load Balancer (NLB)?
- Goal 9: Cleanup


### Goal 1: Create EKS Cluster with `eksctl`

Make sure you have latest `eksctl` installed and you should be able to create EKS cluster with minimal setup as follow.

```sh
% eksctl create cluster -f ./cluster-config/cluster-minimal.yaml
```

</details>

Verify the EKS nodes are running.

```sh
% kubectl get nodes
NAME                              STATUS   ROLES    AGE     VERSION
ip-192-168-121-236.ec2.internal   Ready    <none>   5m47s   v1.29.0-eks-5e0fdde
ip-192-168-90-226.ec2.internal    Ready    <none>   5m49s   v1.29.0-eks-5e0fdde
```

### Goal 2: Deploy nginx with Application Load Balancer (ALB)

At this stage, you would need to have `kubectl` installed. Then you should be able to create `Deployment`, `HPA`, `Service` and `Ingress` resources.

```sh
% kubectl apply -f ./examples/simple/
deployment.apps/nginx-deployment created
horizontalpodautoscaler.autoscaling/nginx-hpa created
ingress.networking.k8s.io/nginx-ingress created
service/nginx-service created
```

Make sure everything run as expected

```sh
% kubectl get pods,deployments,hpa,service,ingress
NAME                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/nginx-deployment-598bb489bf-c55jl   1/1     Running   0          35s
pod/nginx-deployment-598bb489bf-x86dd   1/1     Running   0          35s

NAME                                READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
deployment.apps/nginx-deployment    2/2     2            2           35s

NAME                                            REFERENCE                     TARGETS         MINPODS   MAXPODS   REPLICAS   AGE
horizontalpodautoscaler.autoscaling/nginx-hpa   Deployment/nginx-deployment   <unknown>/80%   2         10        2          34s

NAME                    TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
service/kubernetes      ClusterIP   10.100.0.1      <none>        443/TCP        16m
service/nginx-service   NodePort    10.100.94.158   <none>        80:31251/TCP   34s

NAME                                      CLASS   HOSTS                ADDRESS   PORTS   AGE
ingress.networking.k8s.io/nginx-ingress   alb     entry1.example.com             80      35s
```

### Goal 3: Find out why Application Load Balancer (ALB) not working?

```sh
% kubectl get ingress nginx-ingress
NAME            CLASS   HOSTS                ADDRESS   PORTS   AGE
nginx-ingress   alb     entry1.example.com             80      50s # <-------- no address shown, why?
```

After fixing the issue, you should be able to see command output as follow,

```sh
% kubectl get ingress nginx-ingress
NAME            CLASS   HOSTS                ADDRESS                                    PORTS   AGE
nginx-ingress   alb     entry1.example.com   k8s-default-XXX.REGION.elb.amazonaws.com   80      60s
```

Once the Load Balancer is created, you should be able to visit the application via the endpoint of load balancer with default `HTTP` protocol.

### Goal 4: Find out why Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) not working?

```sh
% kubectl get hpa nginx-hpa
NAME        REFERENCE                     TARGETS         MINPODS   MAXPODS   REPLICAS   AGE
nginx-hpa   Deployment/nginx-deployment   <unknown>/80%   2         10        2          68s
```

Did you aware that HPA is not working... why? :thinking:

After you fixed the HPA issue, it should shown as follow

```sh
% kubectl get hpa nginx-hpa
NAME        REFERENCE                     TARGETS   MINPODS   MAXPODS   REPLICAS   AGE
nginx-hpa   Deployment/nginx-deployment   2%/80%    2         10        2          2m7s
```

### Goal 5: HPA is working. Now I want to set Nginx replicas with `kubectl scale ...` but failed. Why?

```sh
% kubectl scale --replicas 12 deployment nginx-deployment
deployment.apps/nginx-deployment scaled
```

Why the Pod count not able to reach desired pod count `12` but quickly scale down back to `2`... why is that ?

### Goal 6: Remove HPA and try to scale to `40` manually

```sh
% kubectl delete hpa nginx-hpa
horizontalpodautoscaler.autoscaling "nginx-hpa" deleted
```

```sh
% kubectl scale --replicas 40 deployment nginx-deployment
deployment.apps/nginx-deployment scaled
```

```sh
% kubectl get deployment
NAME               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
nginx-deployment   25/40   40           25          11m <-------- stock at "25/40" ...why?
```

```sh
% kubectl get pods
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-deployment-598bb489bf-c55jl   1/1     Running   0          6m15s

nginx-deployment-598bb489bf-fw52n   0/1     Pending   0          6m15s # <-------- Pending
nginx-deployment-598bb489bf-x86dd   0/1     Pending   0          6m15s # <-------- Pending
... (omitted)
```

### Goal 7: Try to turn ALB entry from HTTP to HTTPS

Service with `HTTP` is clearly unsafe, how to made it safe with `HTTPS`?

### Goal 8: How to switch to Network Load Balancer (NLB)?

If you solve can provision ALB then you should be able to create NLB as well. But how...? :thinking:

### Goal 9: Cleanup

Terminate all resources that we created earlier.

```sh
% kubectl delete -f ./examples/simple/ --ignore-not-found
```

Terminate the EKS cluster

:warning: **_WARNING: all resources will be removed permanently, unrecoverable_**

```sh
% eksctl delete cluster -f ./cluster-config/cluster-minimal.yaml
```

**OPTIONAL** Cleanup IAM User/Role/Policy and [Identity Provider (IdP)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home?#/identity_providers) with care.

### Bonus

There's another repository with common used addons installation scripts:
